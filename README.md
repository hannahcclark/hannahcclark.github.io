========================
Personal Website

As much as I can tell, everything has been correctly implemented as per the Portfolio project for Comp 20, although I do use the `<br/>` tag in the html. It may be possible to later use different sections with padding or margins for that affect, but possibly not in all cases. I discussed how to structure html and use `<div>` and unordered lists to best effect with Arthur Berman. I also discussed background opacity with Kyle Slinger and Thomas Colgrove. I'm not entirely sure how much time I spent on this project, but it was likely in the range of 5-10 hours and also mostly due to being more particular than needed about the style I wanted and the bio and homepage content.
