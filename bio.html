        <p>I began programming my freshman year of high school, and took as many programming courses as my high school offered, including an independent study in creating GUIs in Java, and a Mobile App Development class focussed on iOS. As a capstone project for the engineering program at the school, I developed a basic grade book software for OS X.</p>
        <p>I'm currently a junior at Tufts University School of Engineering majoring in Computer Science. Some interesting courses I have taken include <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/50CP/">Concurrent Programming</a>, in which the threading and message passing models of concurrency were explored using Python, C, and Erlang, and <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/111/">Operating Systems</a>, focused on components of operating systems and tradeoffs in their design. I am currently working on a capstone project for my degree at Tufts, an iPad application for the radiology department at Tufts Medical to use in lectures for medical students and residents.</p>
        <p>During my sophomore year, I was a teaching assistant for the <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40/">Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming</a> course at Tufts. Since September 2014, I have been a teaching assistant for the <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/">Programming Languages</a> course at Tufts.</p>
        <p>I also take part in the Computer Science Exchange and Women in Computer Science organizations at Tufts. I am a member of the Tau Beta Pi chapter at Tufts and take part in its community service committee.</p>

        <p>My other interests include cooking, <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/people/hcc3">knitting</a>, calligraphy, hiking, rock climbing, and kayaking.</p>
