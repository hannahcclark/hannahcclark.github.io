        <p><span class="slant">A simulation of the MBTA's Red Line in Erlang, </span> November, 2014</p>
        <p>This was completed as a final project for <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/50CP/">Concurrent Programming</a> in collaboration with Raewyn Duvall and Andrew Stephens. This project allows for the simulation of the Ashmont direction of the Red Line, where users may input varying numbers of passengers, schedule trains, and force delays on trains then view the result to analyze the effects on travel times. While it likely does not follow best practices for Erlang, it was an interesting exercise in concurrent simulation and is of reasonable quality given the time period available for the project.</p>

        <p><span class="strong">An iPad application to improve radiology lectures, </span> September, 2014 - Current</p>
        <p>This project serves as my capstone project for my degree through the Tufts School of Engineering. It was initially designed by Emily Carlin, Riley Jack Meehan, Aaron Tietz, and Shiwan Zuo, as part of a class with <a href="http://benshapi.ro/">Ben Shapiro</a>, the advisor for this project. The programming was done in collaboration with Andrew Dempsey and Hamid Mansoor. We have been working with the radiology department at Tufts Medical Center to best meet their needs to improve the quality of and student engagement in radiology lectures given to medical students on rotation. The app allows students to analyze images provided by lecturers and identify abnormalities and lecturers to display the responses. The goal is to increase the amount of students participating in each lecture and to spark discussions between students as well as between the students and lecturers.
